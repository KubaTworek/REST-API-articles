### Database

You need to have **MySql** installed on your machine to run the API.

After creating the API database, you need to add your **MySql** root `username` and `password` in the `application.properties` file on `src/main/resource` and `url` to empty database schema. The lines that must be modified are as follows:

```properties
spring.datasource.url=
spring.datasource.username=
spring.datasource.password=
```
